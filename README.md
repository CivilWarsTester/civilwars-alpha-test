## CivilWars - Alpha v1.2.0 - Player Level Update

CivilWars next huge update is arriving soon! The theme of it will be the leveling system.
Yes, finally you will get XP for your game interactions, so another crucial feature gets added!
The game gets enhanced and upgraded as the UI will remain the same (no UI upgrade soon)!
New goals, new features, new UI elements... That's Player Level Update

### Here is the list of all the <ins>planned features:</ins>

* Player Level gets reworked
* XP counts after upgrade and build
* XP Level caps/border will be added and calculated
* 25 levels gets added initially and later it will be extended
* Idle XP farming gets added (you will get some XP for just AFK-ing)
* Titles/ranks and buffs comes with certain levels (jubilee levels and so on)

For now, that's it. These are the features planned to be released by Alpha v1.2.0.

### CivilWars - Alpha v1.2.0 - Player Level Update - coming on March 26th, 2025
